Overview
This project uses an ESP32-S3 board running Open E-Paper Link (OEL) firmware to update an e-paper display with Airbnb guest booking info — all managed via Home Assistant automations and webhook-triggered updates.

Hardware Requirements
ESP32-S3 development board (with built-in BLE)
Compatible e-paper display (e.g., Waveshare, LilyGo)
Optional: Battery (e.g., 18650 Li-ion) for portable operation - i have this esp permanently plugged in via usb C

Step 1: Flash Open E-Paper Link Firmware
Download the latest ESP32-S3 compatible firmware from the OEL GitHub releases.
Use esptool.py or ESPHome-Flasher to flash the firmware onto your ESP32-S3.
On first boot, the device will create a Wi-Fi access point (OEL-Setup). Connect your PC or phone to this network.
Navigate to http://192.168.4.1 in your browser and enter your Wi-Fi and MQTT broker credentials.

Step 2: Install Open E-Paper Link Integration in Home Assistant
Install via Home Assistant Community Store (HACS):
If you don’t have HACS installed, follow the official guide to set it up first.
In HACS, go to Integrations, search for Open E-Paper Link, and install it.
Restart Home Assistant after installation.

Configure Integration:
Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration.
Search for Open E-Paper Link and add it.
Provide your MQTT broker information if required (often auto-configured if MQTT is already set).
The integration will discover your ESP32-S3 device automatically if it’s connected to the same MQTT broker.

Verify Device Availability:
Once added, the e-paper display device will appear under Devices.
You can now call services like open_epaper_link.drawcustom in automations or scripts to update your display.

Step 3: Automate Updates for Battery Efficiency
Updates to the e-paper display are on-demand only — triggered by Home Assistant automations when booking data changes.
This avoids continuous polling, maximizing battery life and minimizing power consumption.

Key settings to maximize efficiency include:
ttl set to around 60 seconds (device sleeps quickly after update)
dither: false to reduce processing
dry-run: false to perform real updates only when needed

Why ESP32-S3?
Integrated BLE support for future-proof wireless options.
Efficient power usage suitable for battery-powered e-paper setups.
Supports all features of Open E-Paper Link firmware seamlessly.
