🧰 Requirements
Windows 10 or later
Admin access (or ability to install software)
Internet access

✅ Step 1: Install Python (if not already installed)
Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
Download the latest stable version (e.g., Python 3.12).
Run the installer:
✅ Check the box that says: Add Python to PATH
Click "Install Now"
Create 

✅ Step 2: Open a Command Prompt
Press Windows + R, type cmd, then press Enter.
Navigate to the project folder where your flask_server.py file is stored:
cd path\to\your\project\flask_server
create the flask_server.py using the code at /flask server code

✅ Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
This will create a venv folder in your project directory.

✅ Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment
venv\Scripts\activate
You should see (venv) at the beginning of your command line prompt.

✅ Step 5: Install Dependencies
Install Flask and requests manually:
pip install flask requests

✅ Step 6: Run the Flask Server
python flask_server.py
Your server should start and listen on http://localhost:5000 or your chosen port.

✅ Step 7: Create a .bat File to Run Server Automatically
You can use Notepad to create a .bat (batch) file that automates steps 4–6.

💡 How to Create the Batch File:
Open Notepad
Paste the following code into it:
@echo off
cd /d path\to\your\project\\flask_server
call venv\Scripts\activate
python flask_server.py
pause

🔁 Replace the path with the exact path to your Flask script
Go to File → Save As
Change Save as type to All Files
Name the file: start_flask_server.bat
Save it somewhere convenient (e.g., Desktop or project folder)

▶️ To run it:
Just double-click the .bat file
A terminal window will open and start the server

🧠 Optional: Run on Startup (Automatically)
If you want this script to run every time you boot your PC:
Press Win + R, type shell:startup, press Enter
Copy your start_flask_server.bat into that folder
Your Flask server will run when Windows starts.

🧪 Test It
Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:5000/
